In 1890, Polish physiologist Adolf Beck first captured and recorded brain waves in dogs and rabbits.

Lack of oxygen in the brain for 5 to 10 minutes results in permanent brain damage.

Your brain keeps developing until your late 40s.

The human brain makes up just 2% of the body's weight, but uses around 20% of its energy.

When awake, the human brain produces enough electricity to power a small light bulb.

The human brain has about 100,000,000,000 (100 billion) neurons. 

Neurons multiply at a rate 250,000 neurons/minute during early pregnancy.

It is estimated that a baby loses about half their neurons before they are born. This process prunes neurons that do not receive sufficient input from other neurons.

Commisurotomy, the separation of the brain's two hemispheres, is one treatment for severe epilepsy. As a result of this separation, words presented to a patient's far left visual field cannot be read (alexia), and hidden objects placed into the right visual field cannot be named (anomia).

There is no sense of pain within the brain itself. Neurosurgeons can probe areas of the brain while the patient is awake.

At night, our peripheral vision is better than our foveal (straight on) vision. Hikers at night do better when they look slightly above the trail, and airplane pilots are taught to look for traffic out of the sides of their eyes.

Injury releases endorphines, naturally occurring opiates which block pain sensation. One theory as to why we scratch itches: scratching injures our skin a little, releasing a flood of endorphins to block the pain of the initial injury more effectively.
